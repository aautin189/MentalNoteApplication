APP: 
- Capstone
- Notetaking web application
	- backend server to handle user registration
	- backend server to handle user authentication
	- frontend ONLY handles 3/6 views that can render in this application



Tried to incorporate that lab18 User Management System into my backend layer.
I need my existing server to render the first two views (in the browser).
	> I also need my existing server to pass data to my frontend layer so it can render all the rest of my views (in the browser)
